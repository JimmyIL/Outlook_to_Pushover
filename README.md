# Outlook_to_Pushover
simple powershell snippet checking for unread messages in outlook and sending a push notification using 'pushover' api to any device you choose.
(this can be used for more than just email notifications) (also this can be ran on any machine and not just your local computer, but needs access to source (email))


## Instructions:

-download the Pushover app on ios or android
-signup and create a "user/profile"
-your userapi key is made afterwards
-your api access key and api secret key are on the app
- make sure your computer/workstation is plugged in and any auto logout/sleep feature is disabled so it can continue to run.
- make sure there are no currently unread emails prior to use as this only goes by 'count' not actual email matches (next feature maybe)

created/ran on PC, windows 10, should work on PS 5+
